## Collections

Collection refers to a group of objects or values into a single entity

To represent collection in java, Collections framework is used which provides certain classes and interfaces

In brief, a "Collections Framework" is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.


## Why Collections when we have arrays

We might wonder why to use to collection when we have arrays. Even they can store multiple objects or data as single entity.

There are few limitations with arrays like:

1. Array size is fixed, we cannot change it dynamically
1. It stores only similar data types (of course we have a workaround using object array which stores any value or object we want)
1. They do not have readily available data structure methods like searching largest value, finding a particular value. We have to define them
